##Flow

1) First time accessing, user will be directed to _Onboarding_ screen - must enter values in first and last name as well as an email address in a valid format
2) Upon successful registration, the _Home_ screen will display with header, 'hero section' and menu list
3) The user may filter the list by typing something in the hero section to match content in the title of the menu item
4) The user may use the buttons to filter on categories - click on the button will show only items in the category, clicking off will reset them
5) Both filters may be used together - e.g. search for 'gr' and click on 'Starters' will only display 'Greek Salad'
6) Clicking on the Profile picture in the header will bring the user to the _Profile_ page
7) The _Profile_ page shows the registration info, 'Logging out' will remove the info and force the user to re-register via the _Onboarding_ page. 
8) Use back button to navigate back
